        <h1>Dear <span class="company"></span>:</h1>
        <p>
          I was excited to see your opening for a customer service rep, and I hope to be invited for an interview.
        </p>
        <p>
        My background includes serving as a customer service associate within both call-center and retail environments. Most recently, I worked on the customer service desk for Discount-Mart, where my responsibilities included handling customer merchandise returns, issuing refunds/store credits, flagging damaged merchandise for shipment back to vendors and providing back-up cashiering during busy periods.
        </p>
        <p>
        Previously, I worked within two high-volume customer-support call centers for a major telecommunications carrier and a satellite television services provider. In these positions, I demonstrated the ability to resolve a variety of issues and complaints (such as billing disputes, service interruptions or cutoffs, repair technician delays/no-shows and equipment malfunctions). I consistently met my call-volume goals, handling an average of 56 to 60 calls per day.
        </p>
        <p>
        In addition to this experience, I gained considerable customer service skills during my part-time employment as a waitress and restaurant hostess while in high school.
        </p>
        <p>
        I also bring to the table strong computer proficiencies in MS Word, MS Excel and CRM database applications and a year of college (business major). Please see the accompanying resume for details of my experience and education.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am confident that I can offer you the customer service, communication and problem-solving skills you are seeking. Feel free to call me at <span class="number"></span> to arrange an interview. Thank you for your timeâ€”I look forward to learning more about this opportunity!
